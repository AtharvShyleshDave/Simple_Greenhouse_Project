This system monitors two temperature points using DS18B20 sensors and activates a 4-relay module based on temperature thresholds. It is built on an Arduino Uno microcontroller and suitable for basic HVAC or safety alert systems.
Furthermore, the relay module operates on 4 devices: 2 exhaust fans and 2 mist sprays. The entirety of the circuit is programmed in order to operate based on the specified requirements of temperatures. 
This project primarily focuses on the control of surplus temperature, with a possibility of further enhancement for future purposes.
